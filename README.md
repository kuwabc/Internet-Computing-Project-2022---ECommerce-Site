# Internet-Computing-Project-2022---ECommerce-Site
MSU 2022 Group Project - ECommerce Website

# Project Summary
In Spring 2022, this project was used to test our competency in creating a simple website that would demonstrate our understanding in front-end design with some back end contents. 
This was a group project done with different individuals from my course. This was a shared effort. In my future assignment for Database Systems, I used this assignment as a template for the creation of my ECommerce site since both projects were fundamentally similar, but just had different documentation requirements.

These are just the source files - we did use content from online and credited it in the report at turn in - these files just represent the work we did and modifications to code we needed to get to our product

Group Members - Cassie, Catherine, Kelsie, and Allison
