# Internet-Computing-Project-2022---ECommerce-Site
MSU 2022 Group Project - ECommerce Website

# Project Summary
In Spring 2021, this project was used to test our competency in creating a simple website that would demonstrate our understanding in front-end design with some back end contents. 
This was a group project done with different individuals from my course. This was a shared effort. In my future assignment for Database Systems, I used this assignment as a template for the creation of my ECommerce site since both projects were fundamentally similar, but just had different documentation requirements.
